                <p>We start by supposing that the speed of light is variable from place to place in the Universe. This is Einstein's original idea from his 1911 paper <em>On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light</em> which he later disregarded, because it predicted half the correct value for light rays bending around the Sun. A parallel between electric and gravitational interactions guided Einstein to develop a gravitational vector potential in his 1912 paper <em>Is There a Gravitational Eﬀect which is Analogous to Electrodynamic Induction?</em> It was discovered that had he included both the scalar and a vector potential the correct value for the bending of light rays is obtained, as developed by Carver Mead's G4V Theory or <em>Engineering View of Gravitation</em>. Furthermore, G4V correctly predicts standard tests of General Relativity to first order beyond Newtonian, including for perihelion precession, Gravity Probe B, gravitational redshift, Shapiro delay, with the nice bonus of using wave units and matter waves instead of particles, an insight developed only after the advent of Quantum Mechanics.</p><p>Thus it seems clear to me that a 4-potential gravitational theory could provide a simpler explanation of gravitational interactions without invoking curved space. Instead of curving space to keep $c$ constant, why not <em>"curve"</em> $c$ to keep space flat? This begs the question, what exactly is the mechanism by which matter interacts to change the speed of light? Perhaps, Erik Verlinde's Entropic Gravity or an <span class="annotation annotation_1">

It's worth mentioning that Einstein himself adviced against using General Relativity's geometric interpreation of curved space and gravity as a ficticious force for anything more than a mental aid, the theory provides no basis on what space actually is and the mechanism by which matter-energy curve it, it just kicks back the can, and still lacks a phenomenological explanation.</p><p>Mead develops G4V on top of <span class="annotation annotation_2">

Lengths and the quantity $mc$ are thus <em>gravitationally-invariant</em>. There's another possibility if the meter instead be treated as gravitationally-dependent. To start let's revisit Abraham's original thought experiment that if an antenna of 1-m length is brought from a region of $c_1$ to a region of $c_2$ then it's length (supposedly) would remain constant and the <span class="annotation annotation_3">

If $c_2 : c_1 = D$, then $\tau_2 = \tau_1 / D$. Since proper time is invariant, the local observer would see no change in the period of the clock. And outsider measuring his clock would see a longer period, conversely a local observer would measure his period as shorter compared to an outside clock.</p>
