    Hi!<br><br>
    I'm Dimitar Sotirov, a student and a game programmer at <u>Gameloft, Sofia</u>.<br>
    <br>
    In programming I value:<br>
    * <u>High-performance</u> - no need to accelerate climate change
    by wasting CPU clock cycles.<br>
    * <u>Quality</u> - code with lots of comments. Maximizing readibility, minimizing
    dependencies and lines of
    code, because every LOC is a liability.<br>
    * <u>Discipline</u>. As in any engineering field,
    the final software product should be robust and maintainable.<br>
    <br>
    I'm not saying this way of programming is <b>THE</b> way to program... :)<br>
    It's just suited better in the context of stuff I'm interested in -
    libraries used for embedded software, game engines
    or in general - code that other <i>developers</i> use.<br>
    <br>
    That's why "it just works" is not enough for me (as it may be
    for <i>application</i> developers) and I need to make
    sure what I write stands the test of time. For this reason, I
    tend to avoid modern programming practices, which are aimed
    at fast iteration, but tend to have poor performance, raise
    complexity and code coupling significantly - such as OOP,
    modern C++, etc.<br>
    <br>

    <a href="https://github.com/Repertoi-e/light-std" target="_blank">lstd</a> - C++
    library
    that aims to replace the standard library:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sweet spot between low-level and high-level.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Encourages <u>data oriented programming</u>.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <u>Respects CPU cache</u> by thinking about the memory
    layout.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ditches smart pointers, RAII, and copy/move
    constructors.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Written from scratch with simplicity in mind.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Long term developement since 2017.<br>
    <br>
    A physics engine<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Logic is written in Python.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Rendering is done with C++ and DirectX.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Structured to handle <u>live code reloading</u> (C++ and
    Python).<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Written from scratch (using lstd).<br>
    <br>
    A graphing calculator<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Parsing arbitrary math expressions.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Drawing plots live at 60 FPS.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - .. Another battle-test for lstd.<br>
