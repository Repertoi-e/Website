                                    This notebook is an in-depth tutorial on the mathematics behind
                                    implementing a rigid body physics engine. We'll explore
                                    how you can take equations from physics and apply them in discrete
                                    time steps, how to check for intersecting objects, and how to generate
                                    a collision response.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    We will interop two progrmaming languages so we can use C++ for rendering
                                    and Python for the simulation. This lets us focus on the logic
                                    and not deal with the quirks and verbosity of low-level languages.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    When simulating physics we show interaction between objects graphically and
                                    try to model real-life phenomena - mass, forces, acceleration and velocity,
                                    soft/rigid bodies, even fluids, heat flow etc. This is very useful and has
                                    enormous practical applications for engineering, physics, chemistry and
                                    of course for entertainment (e.g. CGI in movies and games).

                                    In this project we explore ways to classify news written in Bulgarian
                                    in two classes: real or "fake" (click-bait), using standard supervised
                                    machine learning methods.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Two types of features are used: the text content, which is vectorized
                                    with TF-IDF, and engineered features - Flesch Readibility Ease,
                                    words to character ratio, average word length, average sentence length,
                                    etc.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The result is about 82% accuracy and "real" news seems to be the easier
                                    class. The model is serialized and ready to be deployed with a small
                                    Python program and Flask.

                                    Here we do exploratory data analysis on a large movie dataset.
                                    We tidy and cleanup the data and then check pre-formulated hypothesis
                                    on it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Are more movies being released in recent years?<br>
                                    Are certain genres more popular throughout the years?<br>
                                    Does runtime depend on the genre of the movie?<br>
                                    Is there a link between runtime and quality of the movie?<br>
                                    Is there a link between movie genres and poster color intensity?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The short answer to all the questions above is yes (except the last one).
                                    However the long answer is not so simple. Many factors might come into
                                    play and to say there is direct correlation is rather naive.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    We also explore geography (countries in which movies are released)
                                    and all of this is accompanied by pretty plots and diagrams.
