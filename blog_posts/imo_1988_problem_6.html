 Today I'd like to share the problem which has a reputation of being the hardest ever set on the International Mathematical Olympiad.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 That's some serious business! And... the goal here is not simply to present
 <i>
  a
 </i>
 solution, but to walk you through 3 increasingly-brilliant insights, that give rise to a genius solution, and in the end hopefully make you feel like a better problem-solver, armed with some new... super tools of sorts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 <h4>
  0. Story
 </h4>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 It is about problem 6 from the 1988
 <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/" target="_blank">
  IMO
 </a>
 . I got obsessed over it a few days ago when Numberphile uploaded a video, featuring Zvezdelina Stankova, the only girl to solve the problem at the competition, who shares Emanouil Atanassov's solution, for which he won a special brilliancy award.
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 <span class="note">
  Both Zvezdelina and Emanouil are Bulgarians, so this resonates with me on one more dimension.
 </span>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 I recommend watching the original video, but here I present a brief overview of the solution Zvezda talks about. My contribution is that I'll highlight and delve more into the interesting mathy-some-what-philosophical ideas you can think about when cracking this problem wide open.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 <h4>
  1. The Statement
 </h4>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 Let $a$ and $b$ be natural numbers, such that $1 + ab$ divides $a^2 + b^2$.
 <br/>
 Prove that
 <br/>
 $$\frac{a^2 +b^2}{1 + ab}$$
 <br/>
 is a perfect square.
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 <span class="note">
  Problem 6, 1988 IMO
 </span>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 Note: a perfect square is a number in the form $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ... n^2$.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It's genuinely a hard number theory problem. Just to be clear, it asks about specific numbers $a$ and $b$ which, when plugged in the equation, equal a whole number. Now it's easy to see that's not always the case. In fact, most of time the result is going to be a fraction. The problem says that we don't care about those cases ("Throw them to the dogs!", as a Math teacher used to tell us).
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 $$\frac{6^2 +3^2}{1 + 6*3} = \frac{693}{19}$$
 <br/>
 <span class="note">
  No good, we don't bother further with this.
 </span>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 The ratio seems so important that we naturally might give it a letter, for example $r$. What is not obvious at all is why does $r$ (when it happens to be a whole number) necessarily has to be a perfect square?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Now, you are not at the IMO, there's no time pressure. You are at home maybe. Perhaps, grab out a pen and a piece of paper to follow along.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 ...
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Where to start?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 To reassure yourself the problem even makes sense, imagine trying to find a triplet of $a$, $b$ and $r$ which satisfies the condition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 You might even write a quick program so the computer does the hard work for you.
 <br/>
</p>
<pre><code class="language-klipse-pyodide">
import math
for a in range(1, 100):
  for b in range(1, 100):
    r = (a**2 + b**2) / (1 + a * b)
    if r.is_integer():
      r = int(r)
      #print(f"Found a, b = {a}, {b}, r = {r}")

</code></pre>
<p>
 <span class="note">
  Try to remove the '#' from the print statement in the code box above. It's interactive!
 </span>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 Eventually you might stumble upon a solution like $(a, b) = (112, 30),\ r = 4$.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 When doing Math sometimes numbers are completely left-out! So it's always nice to have a concrete example on the side when working on abstract problems such as this one.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Now back to the equation. If you look closely, it might look at you back with a sort of beautiful symmetry: it doesn't matter if $a$ is $a$ and $b$ is $b$. They can switch places!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 $$r = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{1 + ab} = \frac{b^2 + a^2}{1 + ba}$$
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Before and after - it's the same statement. So that implies that any solution we find also has a twin. So from the earlier example $(a, b) = (30, 112),\ r = 4$ is also a solution.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 <h4>
  2. ...constants, parameters and variables?
 </h4>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 There are
 <b>
  3
 </b>
 unknowns here, so you might get stumbled and think - there's nothing much to do with rearranging
 <b>
  one
 </b>
 equation without having more information beforehand - without having something to constrain it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 And that's a very good intuition! A very good rule of thumb in Math is that if you have 3 variables, to solve for them, you need 3 equations. You can think of it as if one equation "locks" in a relationship between one of the variables and the rest.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I remember in high-school when there was a geometry problem which also required algebra I would get stuck rearranging equations, finding the same
 <br/>
 ratios between variables over and over again, because I was trying to solve for e.g. 3 variables, by having only 2 equations (or two geometrical constraints).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 $$ \left\{
 <br/>
 \begin{array}{ll}
 <br/>
 3x^2+y+z = 10\\
 <br/>
 \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}=3y\\
 <br/>
 \frac{z}{x+y}=2
 <br/>
 \end{array}
 <br/>
 \right.$$
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 ... Don't worry, we are not going to solve this monster. That's not important here. But take a look at the third line, we can instantly get $z = 2(x+y)$. If we substitute our newfound information about $z$ in the first line, we'll get something like: $3x^2 + y + 2(x+y) = 10$. We've eliminated one variable! Bingo!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Now we can solve for either x or y (eliminating one more variable), and then use the second line to finally arrive at a solution. After that we back-track to all the relationships till we get a triplet $(x, y, z)$, which is a solution to the whole system. We might get 0 solutions, infinitely many, or a couple, but the method is the same.
 <br/>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 <span class="note">
  Not every equation can have one of variables isolated on one side-though, so this can sometimes fail, just be careful!
 </span>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 This however, is not the route we're going to take with the IMO problem.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 You might've learned about letters in Math - how they can represent constants (like $\pi$, $\phi$, ...), parameters ($a$, $b$, $c$, ...) or variables ($x$, $y$, $z$, ...) but these are just conventions, which can be shifted. Nothing stops us from using $x$ as a constant and $\phi$ as a variable, for example.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Moreover, how "variable" something is - is entirely context dependent! We are used to thing variables change "more often" than parameters which by themselves change more often than constants.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We build up our mental representation of a situation layer by layer. The lowest layer establishes the deepest aspect of the context - sometimes being so low that it cannot vary at all. For instance, the three-dimensionality of our world is so ingrained that most of us never would imagine letting it slip mentally. It is a constant constant."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Parameters play the role of a "something between a variable and a constant" type. For a clear example let's see the following graph:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <div id="ggb-plot-variables">
 </div>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 We key difference between the three concepts above is the level of variability
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The difference between constants
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But here comes the first key insight
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Let's promote r from a variable to a parameter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 ... about constants, parameters and variables:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 You might've learned in high-school how in Math
 <br/>
 we like to use letters to designate "unknowns"
 <br/>
 or "varying quantities". You are told that constants,
 <br/>
 which are numbers that are fixed in place get special
 <br/>
 letters: c, pi, phi, etc.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Parameters - another set: a, b, c
 <br/>
 and variables:  x, y, z
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In reality though this is just an artificial
 <br/>
 difference in essentially a thing that is entirely
 <br/>
 dependent on context.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For example, I claim, all constants, parameters and
 <br/>
 variables, are...    variables, on different levels.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Example with graph:    y = 2x + c
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
